# E-Commerce-Customer-Shopping-behavior-Analysis

In todayâ€™s world with the advancement in technology, e-commerce has become a vital part of the economy and retail industry. The continued expansion of e-commerce retail has driven consumers of all age groups to use e-retail as a part of their everyday life. The shift in retail sales from brick-and-mortar stores to digital was evident more than ever during the pandemic in 2020. With consumers having a myriad of options to choose from, it has become increasingly difficult for merchants and online shopping portals to engage customers. In such a scenario, it is important for them to deliver a good customer experience. This is where we can leverage the benefit of data that online shopping websites gather by analyzing and drawing meaningful insights. It helps to understand the customers better, recommend products accordingly and increase the conversion rate from a shopper to a customer.  In this project we have analyzed the dataset of a multicategory e-commerce store and made visualization for the key factors affecting the sales like month over month analysis, market basket analysis and trend analysis.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90289879/157993467-efdf0498-adce-4b02-b724-6b5d25346f71.png)
